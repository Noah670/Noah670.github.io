<h1> Fighter Procurement Projects Pick Up Speed  </h1>

<p> Published: <time datetime="2018-09-23T 21:35:00"> Sep. 23,2018, 21:35</time> </p>
<p> <strong>
South Korea’s mega projects to develop indigenous fighters and purchase stealth warplanes are picking up<br> pace as Seoul plans to approve crucial administrative steps at the national <em>defense acquisition program<br> committee</em> in September.</strong></p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140831000277"> 
At the committee, top defense officials are to approve the bidding plan for the <q>KFX project</q> to develop<br> home-built fighters, and the result of negotiations for the <dfn>FX</dfn> stealth fighter procurement project will be<br> reported, sources said. The meaning of FX in military is "Fighter X (next generation fighter aircraft)"<br> (Ref:<a href="http://www.abbreviations.com/term/86334"> <cite>abbreviations.com</cite></a>).
</blockquote>

<p> After giving public notice of the bids for the KFX project this month, the <em>Defense Acquisition Program<br> Administration</em> plans to pick the preferred bidder in November and sign a contract on the system development in<br> December. Korea Aerospace Industries, the country’s sole fighter maker, is likely to be chosen as the system<br> developer.</p>

<p>Observers say that budgetary issues remain a major barrier to the <cite>KFX project</cite>, which seeks to deploy 120 fighters<br> after 2023 to replace South Korea’s aging fleets of F-4s and F-5s. Including both the development and mass<br> production of the envisioned fighters, the project, the country’s largest-ever defense program, is expected to cost<br> nearly <mark>20 trillion won ($19.7 billion)</mark>.</p>
<p>Seoul has sped up the KFX<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> project, which was already more than a decade behind schedule, as concerns have been<br> growing over a possible shortage of fighters in the coming years. The Air Force is expected to face a shortage of<br> around 100 fighters in 2019, when almost all of the F-4s and F-5s will be decommissioned.</p>

<p>Regarding the project, there was some controversy over whether the KFX would take a single-engine platform or a<br> double-engine one. But last month, the government opted for a double-engine platform, which would increase the<br> plane’s overall capabilities despite a potential price increase.</p>
<p>Seoul also seeks to sign the “letter of acceptance” for the FX project as early as September ? a process that would<br> accelerate its acquisition of 40 radar-evading F-35 fighters from the U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin. The FX<br> project is estimated to cost around 7.4 trillion won.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Defense Acquisition Program Administration">DAPA</abbr> is in the final round of negotiations over the price with the U.S. government, while it is in talks over<br> technology transfer and related issues with Lockheed Martin. The FX<a href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a> project is proceeding through a government-to-<br>government foreign military sales program.</p>
